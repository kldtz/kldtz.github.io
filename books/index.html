<h1>Books</h1>
<p>I like books that teach you something, that take you on a journey and open up a part of the world hidden from you before. This is a list of such books that stand out to me because they present things in unusual or unexpected ways.</p>

<summary>The little Schemer (Friedman & Felleisen, 1995)</summary>
<p>Gives you a tour of the foundations of Lisp and casually introduces several profound CS topics, such as higher-order functions, currying (or <em>Schönfinkelisierung</em> as my German linguistics prof liked to call it), continuations, closures, partial and total functions, the halting problem, and finally an interpreter. It does so in the tradition of the Socratic dialogue (interspersed with a lot of happy elephants) and lets you discover things yourself by asking questions instead of just presenting the material. A recurring theme throughout the book is recursion.</p>
<p>A colleague pointed me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language)">Racket</a> and from there I was led to this little book. The first chapters are rather slow if you have a programming background, but your eyes get used to reading a lot of nested parentheses, you recapitulate recursion, and you build functions that will become useful later. In the last three chapters the book picks up speed. I followed along implementing the functions in Common Lisp, however, in hindsight I'd recommend using Racket because the additional <code>func</code>s and <code>funcall</code>s become a bit of a nuisance in the final chapters. A potential downside is that some things are only introduced implicitly, so if you have no previous related knowledge, it might be hard to name the things you've seen and find further material to continue your studies.</p>

<summary>Lingua Latina per se illustrata (Ørberg, 1990, 1991)</summary>
<p>The title of the book summarizes its goal, which is to 'illustrate' or explain Latin by itself. In other words, this book tries to teach you Latin in Latin, and in my eyes, it succeeds at that.</p>
<p>I became interested in Latin when I was about 18 and tried to learn it by myself using a traditional text book. In the beginning I made some progress, but soon got stuck (I think mainly because new vocabulary and grammar was only used in the lessons they were first introduced, so retention and motivation to keep learning quickly became a problem). Luckily I stumbled upon this course and was thrilled to be able to read Latin from day one, albeit in very simple form. After working through the first book cover to cover, reading original texts was still hard and required a lot of dictionary work, but I had built a basic vocabulary and quite some intuition about grammatical structures. Later, at university, I took up Latin classes just for fun and passed the official exams, for which children at schools are usually prepared for four years, within half a year with high marks. I found that my pronunciation did not match the official &quot;German&quot; pronunciation of Latin because I had assimilated Ørberg's style, I also didn't know many of the traditional names for grammatical concepts and was still pretty ignorant about much of Rome's history, which was a disadvantage both in the exams and for reading classical texts.</p>

<summary>Graded Italian reader (Cioffari & Cioffari, 1991)</summary>
<p>This reader teaches you Italian with short stories and after only 80 pages you'll read an adapted version of Franco Sacchetti's <em>Giulietta e Romeo</em> after Luigi da Porto's famous novella. You can start with zero vocabulary. New words (the most frequent 1500) are introduced with English translations on the page of their first appearance.</p>
<p>During a semester break at Leipzig University, I did a two-weeks Italian course. It gave me a very modest vocabulary and an idea about the pronunciation of the language. After the course I stumbled upon this book and immediately dived into the stories. In the end I never developed any active skills in the language and my listening comprehension is lousy, but I had fun reading the stories and learned enough to translate Italian songs and read texts if necessary.</p>

<summary>Persisches Lehr- und Lesebuch (Sobhani, 1971)</summary>
<p>If you open this book, you will find that it consists of two parts: (1) a short introduction and a minimal grammar of Persian in German at the front, and (2) a gradual introduction to the Persian language and culture, starting with the alphabet and after that made up almost entirely of Persian texts, broken up by word lists with translations and very few explanatory sentences in German, which you read back to front. The end of the second part is a Persian-German dictionary, which you can use to look up previously introduced words you have forgotten.</p>
<p>If you start reading the texts and follow the lessons and your native language is an Indo-European language, you'll probably be surprised how familiar syntax and morphology feel and how much of the core vocabulary is related. Don't be fooled by the Arabic script!</p>

<summary>First/second French book after the natural method (Worman, 1883)</summary>
<p>Each lesson of these books is made up of a short text or dialogue with footnotes and an exposition of a small chunk of grammar, everything entirely in French. New vocabulary is introduced with the help of illustrations or in terms of previously introduced language material. If you are looking for a book that is useful for everyday conversations on the streets of a Francophone country today, this book won't be your first choice. As you would expect from the year of publication, the language is dated and a lot of modern vocabulary is missing. To give you an impression, this is a caption of an illustration in the second book: &quot;Un vieux maitre d'ecole tailiant une plume&quot;. However, if you're intrested in reading older literature or you just like to time travel looking at beautiful illustrations, I'd highly recommend these two books.</p>

<h2>Math</h2>

<summary>Higher math for beginners (Zeldovich & Yaglom, 1987)</summary>
<p>This book was originally published in the Soviet Union in 1982 for aspiring physicists and engineers. I would recommend it to any first-semester student who had a bad introduction to derivates and integrals at school. It consists of three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>A high-school level introduction of calculus,</li>
<li>Applications of the math introduced in part one to physics and engineering, and</li>
<li>Additional math topics, mainly the extension to the complex numbers.</li>
</ol>
<p>In their teaching notes at the beginning of the book, they lay out their pedagogical approach to teaching mathematics. Their ideas strongly resonate with me and are applied in the remaining chapters of the book. The basic guiding principle is to go from the particular to the general, which allows the student to develop intuition. Mathematical rigour can be added once an intuitive understanding is in place. Many textbooks unfortunately go the other direction, starting with the most abstract and unmotivated definitions to end with but a few contrived examples.</p>

<summary>Proofs that really count (Benjamin & Quinn, 2003)</summary>
<p>This book contains proofs of a number of different identities. The interesting thing is that &quot;every proof in this book is ultimately reduced to a counting problem—typically enumerated in two different ways&quot;. A lot of the identities are widely known, but the counting proofs provide a new angle on them and help you develop your intuition.</p>
<p>The book was recommended to me by one of my lecturers in Tübingen, who had a lot of fun proving identities by counting. I didn't go through the whole book because some identities were not of much interest to me, but the parts I read made a great impression on me, and I still use the method when thinking about combinatorial problems or when proving identities that can easily be reduced to a counting problem.</p>

<summary>A book of abstract algebra (Pinter, 1990)</summary>
<p>A very accessible introduction to abstract algebra, which you can read almost like a popular science book. It doesn't assume much previous knowledge and provides a lot of context, motivation, and interesting exercises, but still delivers a rigorous treatment of the topics.</p>
<p>The best way to learn math is by solving problems yourself, of course, but if you lack the time or energy to tackle new challenging problems or work your way through definitions, theorems, and proofs, it's nice to be taken by the hand and learn about new concepts just by following along with the text.</p>
